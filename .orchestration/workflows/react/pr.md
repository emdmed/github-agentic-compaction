# Pull Request Workflow

## Process

1. Read diff (current branch vs main/master)
2. Analyze changes
3. Output title + description

## Output

```
PR Title: <imperative mood>
Description: <2-3 sentences: what + why>
```

## Constraints

- Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added") | mention breaking changes
- Output only | NO branch/push/remote PR creation
